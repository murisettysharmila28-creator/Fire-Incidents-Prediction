# Fire Incidents Analysis & Prediction (Machine Learning)

## Project Status
Work in progress — data exploration and feature engineering in progress


## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical fire incident data to identify patterns, risk factors, and trends, with the goal of predicting fire incidents and high-risk scenarios using machine learning. The focus is on transforming raw emergency response data into actionable insights that can support prevention, preparedness, and resource planning.


## Objectives
- Analyze temporal, geographic, and operational patterns in fire incidents  
- Identify key factors associated with high-risk fire events  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict fire occurrence or severity  
- Create an analytics-ready dataset suitable for dashboards and reporting  


## Dataset
- Source: Fire incident / emergency response dataset  
- Data includes:
  - Incident date and time  
  - Location and station area  
  - Property use and incident type  
  - Response metrics and exposure details  


## Work Completed So Far
- Data ingestion and initial cleaning using Python and Pandas  
- Handling missing values and inconsistent formats  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify:
  - Time-based trends (hour, day, month)
  - High-frequency incident types
  - Location-based risk patterns  
- Feature preparation for machine learning models  


## Planned Machine Learning Approach
- Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees  
- Advanced models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Feature engineering using temporal and categorical variables  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC  


## Tools and Technologies
- Programming: Python  
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook  
- Version Control: Git, GitHub  


## Expected Outcomes
- A predictive model to flag potential fire incidents or high-risk conditions  
- Insights into patterns influencing fire occurrence  
- A reusable machine learning pipeline for emergency response analytics
